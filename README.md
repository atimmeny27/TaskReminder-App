# TaskReminder-App
This is my first large scale, solo, unguided Python project. It uses the Kivy framework, and links with SQL databases to keep reminders organized.

It is available on the app store under the name TaskReminder. I am keeping this all open source in hopes it will help someone struggling or in need of help. 

The final version is 1.18, and I have provided 4 previous scripts if you want to try and figure out my thought process. Please reach out and ask questions, I would love to help anyone if I am able to. I have tried to include as many comments as possible to help any viewers.
