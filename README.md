# TaskReminder-App
This is my first large scale, solo, unguided Python project. It uses the Kivy framework, and links with a created SQLite database to keep reminders organized.

I am working on making it available on the app store.

The final version is 1.18, and I have provided 4 previous scripts if you want to see progress stages. Please reach out and ask questions, I would love to help anyone if I am able to. I have tried to include as many comments as possible to help any viewers.

Download the latest version of TaskReminders for macOS here:
[Click to Download TaskReminders](https://github.com/atimmeny27/TaskReminder-App/releases/latest/download/TaskReminders.app.zip)


After downloading:

1. This is a Mac only app, and make sure the .zip file is in your Downloads folder in finder, if an app is already created, you can delete for now, only the .zip is needed
   
2. Open the mac terminal through app library
3. or Command "âŒ˜" and spacebar simultaneously to open spotlight and look up terminal
   
4. Once in terminal, assuming you haven't moved the files from Downloads or renamed anything


6. Paste [code](sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Users/**Your Username here**/Downloads/TaskReminders.app.zip)
7. This command will remove the auto generated quarantine attributes with "xattr -d" since this is only a web app right now
8. This command requires admin privelages through "sudo", so enter your password to confirm
9. Once this is done, you can click on the .zip file to create a functioning application
10. Read through the in-app help section to get started
   
    (Optional) Open finder and drag the app from Downloads to Applications to add to app library
